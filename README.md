# StrangeView

StrangeView is a small experiment that I develop during my free time to learn and
improve my skills with [Golang](https://golang.org).

It's an application which is using the camera to perform some camera filters and
face detection.

## Features

- [Sobel filter] of the camera view
- BRISK feature extraction and detection

## Copyright

It's an experiment, you can take and reproduce it. But be adviced, it's not supposed
to be used in a production environment!.
